# Display board library
The Display board - the blue one with the LCD on it - has a 128x64 screen on it. This is useful for showing data or graphics.
This library provides the ability to show text, scroll text in any direction. The U8GLib library it is based off of also provides the ability to draw graphics - you can find further documentation specifically on U8GLib online.
## Installation
To install this library, first install the U8glib library folder through the IDE, or by copying it into your Arduino libs folder. Then remove this subfolder from this folder, and copy the Display folder into your Arduino libs folder.
## Examples
Provided is one test sketch which you can find in the examples folder - the Arduino IDE should also pick this up and put it in the file menu.
